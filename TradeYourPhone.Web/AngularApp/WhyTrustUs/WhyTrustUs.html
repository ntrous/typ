            <p>Some people will tell you that if something seems too good to be true, it probably is.</p>
            <p>Well, not this time. We’re legit.</p>

            <p>And to make sure you don’t miss out on our stress-free, quick way to turn your old phone into overnight cash, allow us to put your mind at ease.</p>

            <p>Occasionally, we get an email from customers-who-could-have-been, asking us how they can be sure we won’t just steal their phone.</p>

            <p>The simple answer is this: <span class="green">We would not be able to run a legitimate online business with satisfied customers in almost every state if we STOLE those people’s phones.</span></p>

            <p>The second we steal from anyone is the second Trade Your Phone goes out of business. And we’re here to stay.</p>

            <p>
                Yes, selling your phone to us involves some trust on your part. But it involves trust on our part too. We rely on you being up front about the condition
                of your used phone so that we can pay you the agreed price.
            </p>

            <p>But that’s nothing new. Think about it. Every time you buy something online you’re trusting the person on the other end of the transaction to uphold their half of the bargain.</p>

            <p>That’s when you’re dealing with <span class="underline">individuals.</span> We are a <span class="underline">business.</span></p>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="green">We have an ABN:</span>   That means we’re registered with the government so it is NOT in our interests to scam anybody.</li>
                <li><span class="green">Trade Your Phone offers complimentary tracking codes:</span>   We send you a free postage satchel for your used phone, and give you a code that lets you see where your package is and the moment it reaches us.</li>
                <li><span class="green">This isn’t our first rodeo:</span>   We’ve dealt with hundreds of everyday Aussies looking to turn their old phones into cash…and we pride ourselves on conducting stress-free, fair business.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Everything’s trackable, traceable and completely above board. We wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>

            <p>So, now you know how we roll, <a href="/">head over to our quote page and let’s get started turning your old phone into new money.</a></p>
