                please go to our <a href="/Contact">contact</a> page and let us know. We will sort it out as soon as possible.

            <p>
                Not to worry! Once we recieve your phone(s) we will assess them to ensure they match the model and condition you selected. If your device turns out to match a different
                model or condition than what was selected, we will contact you with a revised offer at which point you can choose to accept or get your device back.

                Does the free Satchel come with tracking?
            </accordion-heading>
            <p>
                It sure does! Once you send the satchel back to us you will be able to watch its progress with the tracking number and see exactly when it arrives at Trade Your Phone!
