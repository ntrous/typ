                Why wouldn't I sell the phone myself on eBay?
            </accordion-heading>
            <p>
                We’re not knocking eBay. But you should know selling phones on there comes with a catch.
                <br /><br />
                After you set up your account, your auction may take
                up to three weeks before someone buys your phone. Once the buyer pays you, PayPal takes their cut of your money and holds it for THREE WEEKS before
                you get it (unless you are a power seller). Then it will take 2-5 business days to transfer the money from PayPal to your bank account.
                <br /><br />
                All up you will have to wait for at least a month from the time you decide to sell, to the time you get the money in your account. That’s IF you
                sell your phone on the first go. We know many people who have had to run several auctions before they sell their phone. And they haven’t always got
                the price they wanted.
                <br /><br />
                It can be frustrating and drawn out. But, it doesn’t have to be. With Trade Your Phone, you’ll KNOW how much you’re going to
                get for your phone and — provided it’s in the condition you say it’s in — we’ll put the money in your account within 24 hours of recieving your phone.
                <br /><br />
