becoming to our relationships, and while many scoff at the thought &#8211; because aren&#8217;t we talking to one or more on our phones? &#8211; I find this has never been more true.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When reports initially came out claiming our addiction to our phones and the need to be connected to so many others via facebook, twitter and so many other social networking sites were making us more and more isolated I was a huge disbeliever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I loved my mobile, it came everywhere with me and I was always checking facebook to see what the latest news was. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether I was out with friends, home with the family or by myself I was glued to my screen and it was ok &#8211; because so was everyone else. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only recently have I begun to rely less on my phone for instant entertainment, and as a result \u00a0have started wanting to be on it less and less. And as this progressed I found out just how rude I was for so many years. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was appalled at how many times I would be speaking to a friend and they would be ignoring me in order to browse facebook or complete a game. Or catching up with someone when their phone would ring and they would have a huge conversation with a partner they were going to see hours later, and had only a small amount of time with me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It has even got to the point where I\u2019ve had to ask my mum on several occasions that online scrabble could wait until I have left. When did it become so ok to be this rude?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite it happening so often, each time someone picks up their phone while I\u2019m still speaking it is more and more hurtful. Initially you blame yourself &#8211; maybe I am just too boring? Maybe I should try harder or be more funny? Maybe they don\u2019t actually like me at all? <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But after reflecting on the issue and seeing how many people are trying to raise this exact point of rudeness I have come to find it is a bad habit that has spiraled out of control into something that is now a social norm. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People may be connected via their phones but they have never been more disconnected in reality. It is very disheartening when you take time to go and see someone and they blatantly show you just how much more important other people are than you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, how many great things are people missing around them due to always looking at a screen? People need to stop relying on their phones for fast and constant entertainment, and need to be capable of doing nothing for two minutes and not being bored. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know for one I am sick of being ignored in favour of Likes and Tweets, and sick of sitting on a train with phone absorbed zombies. I am by no means requesting that everyone stop using their phones all together, because I certainly haven&#8217;t. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the next time you meet up with a friend, your mum or even your partner &#8211; keep your phone in your bag and give them your full attention &#8211; because they deserve that much. <\/span><\/p>\n", "parent": null, "link": "https:\/\/tradeyourphone.com.au\/wpblog\/zombies-are-already-here-and-they-are-rude\/", "date": "2015-11-03T22:24:50", "modified": "2015-11-08T13:17:24", "format": "standard", "slug": "zombies-are-already-here-and-they-are-rude", "guid": "https:\/\/tradeyourphone.com.au\/wpblog\/?p=291", "excerpt": "<p>More and more articles have come out over the past few years on how detrimental our mobile phones are becoming to our relationships, and while many scoff at the thought &#8211; because aren&#8217;t we talking to one or more on our phones? &#8211; I find this has never been more true.
